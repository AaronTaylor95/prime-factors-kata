# Prime Factors Kata

Complete the `PrimeFactors.Generate` method (+ tests) to find which prime factors when multiplied together make the original number.

Use the [composite pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite) to create the structure that will hold each level of factorisation.

```
360 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5

          360
          /  \
        180   2
        /  \
      90   2
      /  \
    30   3
    /  \
  10   3
  /  \
5   2
```
